As the company grows, so do the signs :) Stuart Thomas, Director of CABS Group commented: "It\'s been an incredible journey over the past 6 years. We have gone from being in a rented, shared office to now owning a very large warehouse with office space, storage space, a spray and blast booth - this is a state of the art purpose built building. We always knew good quality hard work would pay off. There have been 50 jobs created and its been nice to be recognised for our hard work, by winning the National Award Fast Growth 50, for being the fastest growing construction company in Wales 2016/17.</p><p>Who knows what the next 6 years will bring, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff for their hard work."</p><img src="/static/news/4.jpg"><img src="/static/news/4-1.jpg">'

Every year the list identifies some incredible businesses that are making a significant difference to their sectors, markets and communities and this year is no exception. Uniquely, all the winners of the Fast Growth 50 are judged solely by the sales growth of the companies over a three year period. To be nominated for this award is an immense achievement in itself...a very proud moment for us all at CABS! This years award ceremony was at Cardiff\'s Motor Point Arena and here is the Chief Executive Stuart Thomas (front centre) with some of his staff and guests celebrating in style. — celebrating success.</p><img src="/static/news/3-1.jpg" alt="news image"><img src="/static/news/3-2.jpg" alt="news image">'
