            main: '<p>Profiled Metal roof sheeting has a long serviceable life if maintained. But neglected repaint guidelines can mean the owner faces early replacement. Over-sheeting is not the simple answer, with problems of weight, condensation & leaks whilst complete roof replacement is costly, disruptive and risks not meeting current building regulations.</p><p>This was the scenario facing the long planned refurbishment to the thriving Battery Retail Park in Birmingham. The PVC coated steel roof sheets had clearly reached their designated “re-paint decision time” and were exhibiting classic age related deterioration of the original factory coating with associated sheet edge corrosion.</p><p>Unwilling to disrupt the constant flow of customers to the busy retail park, planning specifiers took the decision to recoat the roof with DELCOTE® during the phased redevelopment completed this year. This offered negligible site inconvenience during shopping hours and guaranteed complete weather and corrosion resistance for decades to come. Unlike conventional solvent or water-based coatings, DELCOTE® is an inorganic based silicone developed from world leading GE technology that offers primerless resistance to corrosion, UV and extremes of weather and temperature.</p><p>Giromax Qualified Applicator Coatings and Blastings Ltd were awarded the contract to undertake the works on all four phases, first treating the roof to SEAMSIL®, to seal the critical lap joints and fixings followed by two coats of DELCOTE® silicone coating, applied to a finish colour of Goosewing Grey.</p>'
