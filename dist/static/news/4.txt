HAPPY 6TH BIRTHDAY again to CABS - and here is our birthday present to ourselves. As the company grows, so do the signs :) 
Stuart Thomas, Director of CABS Group commented: "It's been an incredible journey over the past 6 years. We have gone from being in a rented, shared office to now owning a very large warehouse with office space, storage space, a spray and blast booth - this is a state of the art purpose built building. We always knew good quality hard work would pay off. There have been 50 jobs created and its been nice to be recognised for our hard work, by winning the National Award Fast Growth 50, for being the fastest growing construction company in Wales 2016/17. 
Who knows what the next 6 years will bring, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff for their hard work."
