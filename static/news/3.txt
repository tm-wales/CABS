#FastGrowth50Awards
CONGRATULATIONS to all the staff at Coating & Blasting Services for being nominated for the 2nd year in a row for being listed in the top 50 of the fastest growing companies in Wales.
#Fastgrowth50 was founded in 1998, celebrating its 20th year, begun when Professor Dylan Jones-Evans created the crazy idea of putting together a project that would identify and celebrate the fastest growing businesses in Wales. Every year the list identifies some incredible businesses that are making a significant difference to their sectors, markets and communities and this year is no exception. Uniquely, all the winners of the Fast Growth 50 are judged solely by the sales growth of the companies over a three year period. To be nominated for this award is an immense achievement in itself...a very proud moment for us all at CABS! 
This years award ceremony was at Cardiff's Motor Point Arena and here is the Chief Executive Stuart Thomas (front centre) with some of his staff and guests celebrating in style. — celebrating success.
