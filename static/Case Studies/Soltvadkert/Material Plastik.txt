Unable to find a specialist spraying contractor capable or confident enough to undertake this project CABS Refurbishment were given the challenge of getting a team to site to cure colour distortion issues to 150m² in Hungary.

In the UK or Western Europe this wouldn’t have been to much of an issue, but this site in Hungary was at the far end of Eastern Europe, and the rural town was nearer to the Russian boarder than any major city.

Added to this the building owner was a major local employer had secured European Government funding, and was expecting a delegation from the EU finance department. The visit was intended to see how their money had been spent and how their investment would affect the local economy, which was driving the quality expectation of the building owner ever higher and higher.

Facing the task of sorting everything locally in Hungary and flying a team to Budapest armed with only a HVLP spraying unit, CABS parachuted a team in. Then breaking all language barriers of which there were many they sourced paint and materials, before the team extensively masked the entrance of the new building including glass balconies and a basket ball court sized area of brand new marble paving slabs ensuring not a drop of bright yellow paint would land on anything other that the cladding CABS corrected to the colour discrepancy in 4 days.

No paint or dry goods, No English speakers, No problem!
